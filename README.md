# Portfolio

This is my portfolio, built on top of a follow-along tutorial on the [official Astro homepage](https://astro.build/). Astro is a framework for building full web pages structures, similar to Next.js or Solid Start, but it focuses on static, content-driven pages with minimal JavaScript.

## TODO
- Redo the base page layouts
- Write content for my projects and professional experience
- etc
