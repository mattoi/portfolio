# Portfolio

I'm going to build my portfolio on top of a follow-along tutorial on the [official Astro homepage](https://astro.build/). Astro is a framework for building full web pages structures, similar to Next.js or Solid Start, but it focuses on static, content-driven pages with minimal JavaScript.

At the moment, this is just where the tutorial ended, but I'll do a new, main branch where I'll turn it into the actual thing.

## TODO
- Create an actual portfolio based off of it
